/**
 * Created by glagolef on 24/12/2018.
 * The number 3797 has an interesting property.
 * Being prime itself, it is possible to continuously remove digits from left to right,
 * and remain prime at each stage: 3797, 797, 97, and 7.
 * Similarly we can work from right to left: 3797, 379, 37, and 3.
 *
 * Find the sum of the only eleven primes that are both truncatable from left to right and right to left.
 *
 * NOTE: 2, 3, 5, and 7 are not considered to be truncatable primes.
